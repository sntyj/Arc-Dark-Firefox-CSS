# Arc-Dark-Firefox-NewTab-Home
Arc-Dark CSS sheet for the new tab and home page in Firefox Quantum.

I based my code on a post posted on Firefox's Support forums (user: cor-el) [here.](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1177844)

**Instructions:**
- **For best results, set your Firefox theme to "Default"**
- Go to Help > Troubleshooting Information (or go to [about:support](about:support))
- Click on "Open Directory" found near Profile Directory
- Create a "chrome" folder if there is not one already created. 
- Copy this file into the chrome folder (or objectively just copy and paste the contents of the file to another "userContent.css")
- Close out of Firefox and open it back up to test

For the hexcode values of the colors, I used [this.](http://www.color-hex.com/color-palette/36646)
