# Arc-Dark-Firefox-CSS
Arc-Dark CSS sheet for new tab page in Firefox Quantum

I based my code on a post posted on Firefox's Support forums (user: cor-el) [here.](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1177844)

**Instructions:**
- Go to Help > Troubleshooting Information (or go to about:support)
- Click on "Open Directory" found near Profile Directory
- Create a "chrome" folder if there is not one already created"
- Copy this file into the newly created chrome folder (or objectively just copy and paste the contents of the file to another "userContent.css")
- Close out of Firefox and open it back up to test

For the hexcode values of the colors, I used [this.](http://www.color-hex.com/color-palette/36646)
